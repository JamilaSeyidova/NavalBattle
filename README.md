software engineering project. Naval Battle


2 java projects were created.

NavalBattle - is the version with sockets(2 players on 1 computer). This was done in order not to complicate very much the existing offline code.

In order to be able to run the code correctly: 
1. run GameServer 
2. run GameClient
(requires modifications but connection and sending information to each other through sockets is established) 


NavalBattle_oofline. -is the version containing multiplayer and single player (easy version only).
(of course, needs some modifications, but playable)

Also see the UML diagrams.

See the difference between 1st version of class diagram and last. (Incremental development was used, so 1st version are the first ideas how the project should have looked)(Unfortunately, no time to graphfically show it, generator is slow, and its needed to be uploaded)
